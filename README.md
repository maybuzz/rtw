## Concept
This concept is called "Programmers on Twitter" and shows the amount of tweets containing certain words. Initially I wanted to setup different rooms to stream different channels. This didn't work out -yet-, so for now there is only one room with one stream. The room contains a chat, a datavis and a counter overview.

### Tags & datavis
I used the tags `javascript`, `html`, `css` and `nodejs` to collect tweets. I used these tweets to create a data visualization. The collected tweets are separated by language. Each language contains it's own tweets. The data is structured in a tree structure. This means there is hierarchy in the data which is translated to the levels of the circles.

## API
The following code snippet show my setup for incoming tweets. I have setup a connection with Twitter and I can collect multiple tags using a stream. I'm using a package called `TwitterStreamChannels`. This allows me to setup a stream and search multiple tags instead of a single search.

```js
const channels = {
	"languages" : ['html', 'css', 'javascript','nodejs']
}

stream.on('channels/languages', function (tweet) {
  // code to append or remove stuff etc
})
```
